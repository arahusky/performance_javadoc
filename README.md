Performance Javadoc
===================

The project adds performance extension into Javadoc. The performance extension is generated for all methods having appropriate annotation. This tool comes with the separation of the measured method and the code (so called workload generator) that actually prepares arguments and instance, with which the measured method will be called.

To have an idea, how this performance extension looks like, you can see the performance extension generated for method ``contains(Object)`` of ``ArrayList`` class, which enables user to select the size of an instance (ArrayList) against which the method performance will be measured.

The project consists of two tools:

<h2>Doclet</h2>
We extended Javadoc standard doclet to generate performance extension, too. This performance extension allows user to select particular workload generator with which he wants to test the particular method, set its arguments and send a measurement request to the measuring server. When the performance results (for this moment only method execution time is supported) are sent back, the graph and table containing results are generated, allowing user to easily read measured values. 

The Javadoc with performance extension is interactive and also reflects the need for immediate results, which means that the preliminary (and possibly imprecise) results are sent back from the measuring server quickly, while the most precise results are sent after longer period of time.

<h2>Measuring server</h2>
The measuring server measures performance of Java methods. While programming the measuring server, we concentrated especcialy on the accuracy of the measurement, which should now support quite precise measurements.

The server supports measuring of multiple methods at the same time, however, in order not to overload it, we allow only one measuring request per one browser at the same time.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
To compile and run the framework, the following software is required:

<ul>
  <li>Java SDK >= 1.7.0</li>
  <li>Apache ANT</li>
  <li>Web browser with JQuery >= 2.0</li>
</ul>

<h2>Compilation and run</h2>
These ANT tasks are available:

<ul>
  <li>main: compiles all sources (into out/classes folder ), creates project documentation (in out/javadoc) and two jar files (out/jars)</li>
  <li>run-server: runs the measuring server</li>
  <li>run-demo: runs our doclet on the demo examples (the generated documentation is located in out/demo)</li>
  <li>clean: removes all content generated by previous tasks (and possible server run) </li>
</ul> 

<h2>Demo examples</h2>
To help you get familiar with our tool, we created several demo examples. These are located in ``src/java-demo`` and when running ``ant run-demo``, the Javadoc created from these examples is generated into ``out/demo`` folder. In order to be able to measure particular method performance, you need to start the measuring server, which can be done by running ``ant run-server``.

<h2>Project documentation</h2>
The project documentation is not very detailed at the moment. To create Javadoc documentation of the measuring server, run ``ant refdoc`` that creates documentation into ``out/javadoc``.
